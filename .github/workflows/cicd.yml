CI pipeline should only:
✔ Install dependencies
✔ Run tests (or lint)
✔ Maybe build Docker image (optional)
No deployment to Kubernetes, because everything is local.
Example .github/workflows/ci.yml:
name: CI Test
on: [push]

jobs:
test:
runs-on: ubuntu-latest
steps:
- uses: actions/checkout@v3
- name: Install dependencies
run: npm install
- name: Run tests
run: npm test
